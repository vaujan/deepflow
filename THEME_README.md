# Theme System Implementation

This project now includes a complete light/dark theme switching system integrated into the sidebar.

## Features

- **Light Theme**: Clean, bright interface with light backgrounds
- **Dark Theme**: Dark interface with dark backgrounds (default)
- **Persistent Storage**: Theme preference is saved in localStorage
- **System Preference Detection**: Automatically detects user's system theme preference
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for theme switching

## Implementation Details

### Theme Context (`src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`)

- React Context for managing theme state
- Handles theme persistence in localStorage
- Detects system theme preference on first load
- Provides `theme` state and `toggleTheme` function

### CSS Configuration (`src/app/globals.css`)

- Two DaisyUI themes: "dark" and "light"
- Dark theme: Dark backgrounds with light text
- Light theme: Light backgrounds with dark text
- Consistent color scheme across both themes

### Sidebar Integration (`src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`)

- Theme toggle button positioned below the feedback menu
- Dynamic icon (Sun for dark mode, Moon for light mode)
- Dynamic text ("Light Mode" for dark mode, "Dark Mode" for light mode)
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

## Usage

1. **Theme Toggle**: Click the theme toggle button in the sidebar
2. **Automatic Detection**: On first visit, theme matches system preference
3. **Persistent**: Your choice is remembered across browser sessions

## Theme Toggle Button

The theme toggle button is located in the sidebar below the feedback menu and shows:

- **Sun icon + "Light Mode"** when in dark theme (click to switch to light)
- **Moon icon + "Dark Mode"** when in light theme (click to switch to dark)

## Technical Implementation

- Uses DaisyUI's `data-theme` attribute for theme switching
- React Context for state management
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

- Additional theme options (e.g., auto-switching based on time)
- Custom color schemes
- Theme-specific component styling
- Animation improvements for theme transitions
