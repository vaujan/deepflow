# 🧭 Noctuna Copywriting Rules

These rules define how the AI should write and speak about **Noctuna** (or Deepflow, haven't decided a name yet), a deep work tracker for creatives and builders who want consistency, not chaos.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Noctuna helps makers, designers, and indie founders protect their focus and build flow — one deep work session at a time.

Every piece of writing should reflect this: calm, intentional, and built around _focus as a craft_.

---

## 🧠 Voice & Tone

**Tone:** Conversational, reflective, and confident.  
**Energy:** Grounded — calm conviction, not hype.  
**Vibe:** Feels like a thoughtful friend who gets your struggles, not a salesman.

**Preferred Words:** focus, flow, build, protect, rhythm, clarity, deep work, progress, discipline, craft.  
**Avoid:** hustle, revolutionize, productivity hack, gamify, disrupt, optimize.

## 💬 Copy Style Examples

### 1️⃣ Tagline / Hook

- Build in peace, not noise.
- Focus is your unfair advantage.
- We don’t track time — we protect it.
- Deep work, without the guilt trip.
- Designed for builders, not busy people.

### 2️⃣ Website Hero + Subtext

**Example A**  
**Hero:** The world’s loud. Your work deserves quiet.  
**Sub:** Noctuna helps you stay in deep focus, so you can make real progress — without burning out.

**Example B**  
**Hero:** Consistency beats motivation.  
**Sub:** Track your deep work sessions and build flow like a craft, not a hustle.

**Example C**  
**Hero:** Do less. Go deeper.  
**Sub:** We help makers cut distractions, not corners.

> **Rule:** Always lead with the user’s emotional pain (distraction, overwhelm) → then show relief (focus, rhythm).

### 3️⃣ Social Copy

Short, scroll-stopping, thoughtful.

**One-liners**

- Deep work isn’t about doing more. It’s about doing what matters — repeatedly.
- You don’t need another productivity app. You need boundaries.
- Flow doesn’t come from intensity. It comes from rhythm.
- The people who win aren’t faster. They’re quieter.
- Protecting your focus is self-respect.

**Thread structure**

1. You’ll never out-hustle distraction.
2. You can only out-discipline it.
3. Start with 90 minutes of deep work tomorrow.
4. Do it again the next day.
5. That’s how you change everything.
